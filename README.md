# VISUAL TOOLTIP
Code for a Wikipedia-like visual tooltip
<br/>
<br/>
It is exactly what it sounds. It's a good-looking tooltip that looks like the one being used on Wikipedia as of March 2019. 
<br/>
## DEMO
<img src="https://github.com/PySaqib/visual-tooltip/blob/master/tooltip-demo.gif?raw=true" alt="Animated Demo GIF" />

## REQUIREMENTS
The code has been written using jquery and SASS. It is not necessary for you to use SASS since there is a compiled CSS version already. I would highly recommend using SASS though.

## FUTURE UPDATES
I'll be more than happy to take any pull requests or issue-fixes. Moreover, I'll keep this repository updated.
